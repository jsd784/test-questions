I led the project from start to finish, from evaluating the system to training the team on how to use it. This implementation improved our expense reporting process by 40%, making it more streamlined and efficient. I also worked closely with the IT department to ensure the system was fully integrated with our ERP system for a smooth transition."

### 3. **How do you stay updated on changes in accounting regulations, such as new GAAP standards?**
   *Answer:*

### 5. **How do you prioritize and manage multiple tasks, particularly during high-volume periods like month-end close?**
   *Answer:*  
   "During high-volume periods, such as month-end or year-end close, I create a detailed checklist to manage my priorities. I break down tasks into manageable segments and allocate sufficient time for each, ensuring that no deadlines are missed. I often start by tackling the most critical or time-sensitive items first, such as reconciliations and journal entries. For less urgent tasks, I set reminders and follow a structured approach to complete them once the immediate priorities are under control."

### 6. **Can you tell us about a time when you helped improve the accuracy of financial reporting in your previous roles?**
   *Answer:*

This change also made it easier to generate financial statements and improved our audit readiness."

### 7. **How do you handle situations where you’ve identified discrepancies during account reconciliations?**
   *Answer:*

   *Answer:*  
   "At PPL Motorhomes, I worked closely with the COO and department heads who did not have a financial background. I often presented financial reports and explained variances to the budget. To ensure they understood, I used clear, non-technical language and provided visual aids like charts and graphs.

   *Answer:*  
   "One potential challenge might be adjusting to a different industry’s financial nuances, but I see this as an opportunity to broaden my expertise.
